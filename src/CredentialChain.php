 * The credential providers this package builds, consulted in order until
 * one answers with unexpired credentials, which are then held for reuse.
 *
 * An expired answer is no answer: it is passed over for the next provider
 * within the same call, exactly as a null one is, since signing with it
 * would only produce a request AWS rejects. Nothing is held for a
 * provider or for a whole round that answered nothing usable, so an
 * instance role, a container credential endpoint or a token file that
 * appears after a worker has started is picked up on the next call rather
 * than shadowed by a remembered failure. Expiry is the credentials' own
 * `isExpired()`, which carries AsyncAws's refresh drift, so nothing here
 * reads a clock.
